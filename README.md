# sys

Retro library from my outdated book ["Java f√ºr Mac OS X"](https://muchsoft.com/java/mac-java-buch.html).

The `Sys` class lets you determine on which system your Java application is running.
Furthermore, it offers methods for cross-platform queries for paths such as the preferences folder.
With this information, you can tune your applications for certain operating systems.

*Please note: This library is deprecated, just like the Apple API it uses. However, there are several alternatives, e.g. the
[Apache Commons library](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-release/org/apache/commons/lang3/SystemUtils.html#IS_OS_MAC_OSX).*
